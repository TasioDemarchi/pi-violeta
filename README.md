# violeta

A minimal, information-first Pi harness. Runs as its own command with its own agent directory (`~/.violeta/agent`), so it never touches gentle-shell.

## Run

```sh
violeta            # symlinked at ~/.local/bin/violeta -> bin/violeta
```

## What you see

- Header: one line, `▍ violeta · pi <version>`.
- Footer, left: project, git branch, working-tree changes — `+` created (green), `~` updated (yellow), `−` deleted (red).
- Footer, right: model, context usage, tokens in/out, session cost.
- `/sidebar` (`on`, `off`, no argument toggles): hides the footer and shows the same information in more detail in a right-hand sidebar — project (name, path, branch), changes (counts plus the file names, capped at 12 with `+N more`), model (id, thinking level, context bar), usage (tokens, cost). Falls back to the footer below ~100 columns or outside fullscreen. The choice is remembered in `violeta.json` (default off).
- Theme `violeta`: base `#7502c7` for borders and selection; a lighter tint of the same hue for accent text so it stays legible.
- Activity line: while the agent works, one line above the editor shows the current phase — `▍ thinking` while the model writes, `exploring` for read-only tools (read, grep, find, ls), `implementing` for edit/write, `checking` for test-like bash commands, `running` for other bash — with three dots that appear and disappear in a loop so the line stays animated while the width never shifts. The line is removed entirely when the agent is idle, and Pi's native Working spinner is hidden while it is active.

## Layout

| Path | Role |
|---|---|
| `bin/violeta` | Launcher: isolates `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`, seeds settings and the NaN provider on first run |
| `extensions/violeta-ui.ts` | Header, footer, `/sidebar` command, activity line |
| `src/changes.ts`, `src/format.ts`, `src/sidebar-content.ts`, `src/sidebar-state.ts`, `src/activity.ts` | Pure logic (tested) |
| `themes/violeta.json` | Palette |

## Notes

- Font is a terminal setting, not Pi's. JetBrains Mono is installed on this machine.
- NaN's key is read at request time from `~/.gentle-shell/agent/auth.json` through `jq`; it is never copied.
- Tests: `npm test`.
